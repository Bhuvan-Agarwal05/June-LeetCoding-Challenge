INVERT BINARY TREE  =>

Invert a binary tree.

Example:
		Input:

		     4
		   /   \
		  2     7
		 / \   / \
		1   3 6   9

Output:

		     4
		   /   \
		  7     2
		 / \   / \
		9   6 3   1

Trivia:
	This problem was inspired by this original tweet by Max Howell:
	Google: 90% of our engineers use the software you wrote (Homebrew), but you canâ€™t invert a binary tree on a whiteboard so f*** off.
